Each Party that discloses information to the other Party is referred to herein as a "Disclosing Party" and each party that receives such information is referred to herein as a "Receiving Party". </br>
Accordingly, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:</br>
</br>
1. Confidential Information.  </br>
(a) As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means  (i) All confidential, non-public or proprietary information about Disclosing Party and its affiliates provided to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party or by its directors, officers, employees, controlling persons, partners, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively, the "Disclosing Party Representatives"); (ii) information concerning the Disclosing Party’s research and development activities; (iii) information concerning the Disclosing Party’s software, source code, object code, computer programs, and all elements of design related to the foregoing (including, for example, programming techniques, algorithms, inference structures and the construction of knowledge bases); (iv) Disclosing Party’s designs, drawings and formulae; (v) Disclosing Party’s cost, profit and market information; (vi) financial and other business information with respect to the Disclosing Party that is not publicly available; (vii) Disclosing Party’s customer information, including products and services of the Disclosing Company orders, process and delivery schedules; (viii) information related to any of the Disclosing Party’s principals, shareholders, officers, managers, members, directors, employees or affiliates that is not publicly available and relates to their interests in or activities relating to the Disclosing Party; (ix) information relating to any third party provided to the Disclosing Party, which the Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential; and any information which the Disclosing Party has labeled as confidential.

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than in a manner not permitted by this Agreement and without violating the legal rights of either Party to this Agreement;  (ii) which the Receiving Party can demonstrate was in the Receiving Party’s possession without any violation of the rights of the Disclosing Party, prior to the Disclosing Party’s disclosure of such information to the Receiving Party; or (ii) which Receiving Party can demonstrate was independently developed by Receiving Party or Receiving Party’s Representatives without use of the Confidential Information.</br>
2. Use of Information; Maintenance of Confidentiality.  The Receiving Party shall: </br>
(a) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating the Potential Transaction, and only for so long as necessary to evaluate the Potential Transaction; provided such period shall be no longer than the term of this Agreement as set forth in Section 16, below;  </br>
(b) not copy, reproduce, consign, reverse engineer, or disclose any Confidential Information to any person other than Receiving Party’s directors, officers, employees, controlling persons, partners, agents, representatives and advisors ("Receiving Party Representatives") who owe an obligation to the Receiving Party to protect the Confidential Information substantially similar to the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement, and who will use the information for the sole purpose of participating in or contributing to decisions regarding the Potential Transaction, except as permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party;    </br>
