               <strong>Cryoablation:</strong> Cryoablation is also known as cryotherapy or cryosurgery. A special probe is inserted into the tumor and then cooled to temperatures well below freezing. A ball of ice forms at the tip of the probe, freezing and destroying cancerous tissue. Cryotherapy is not as invasive as surgery, and can sometimes be performed as an outpatient procedure. Cryotherapy is currently used to treat prostate and kidney cancers. 
               <br><br>
               <strong>Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA):</strong>  A needle-thin probe delivers radiofrequency waves directly to the tumor, heating the tissue until it is destroyed. Radiofrequency ablation is best for smaller, localized tumors. RFA can be used to treat a variety of cancers such as bone cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer.

              <strong>Interventional Oncology (IO)</strong> is a rapidly evolving stream of cancer therapy that is opening new dimensions in curative and palliative care in oncology. IO involves treating tumors under Image Guidance in a minimally invasive manner. Tumor Ablation is one such IO therapy, where an ablative energy like Radio Frequency [RF], Microwave, Cryo or Electrical energy is delivered to the tumor using needle like instruments called electrodes. </p>
              <p>Over the past 15-20 years, Tumor Ablation has been established as an effective therapy for inoperable tumors in liver, lung, pancreas, kidney etc., with 5-yr survival rates comparable to surgery. </p>
              <p>Ablation therapy uses heat or cold to destroy, or ablate, cancer tumors without the need for more invasive surgery. Special probes are used to deliver ablative treatments directly to the tumor. The surgeon relies on computer imaging to guide the probes to the correct position and monitor the progress of the treatment. </p>
              <p>
              Today, ablation is often offered as an alternate to surgery even for operable tumors. While historically ablation was assigned to tumors under 3cm, with newer ablative technologies, ever improving protocols, image fusion planning and assisted navigation, physicians are able to treat larger tumors with ablation, as effectively as smaller tumors.  Tumor Ablation doesn’t involve resection, has negligible side effects, minimum patient downtime and is often offered as a day procedure.</p>
              <p>
              Given the nature of the disease, recurrent tumors can be repeatedly ablated as needed, since the procedure is well tolerated unlike Radiation or Chemotherapy whose toxicity limit the extent to which they can be offered.</p>

              <h5>High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer</h5>
              <p>Also known as HIFU, this procedure is used to treat prostate cancer. A special probe uses high-frequency ultrasound to produce heat that kills cancerous tumors. The probe is inserted into the rectum and guided to the proper position using computer imaging. HIFU can either treat the entire prostate ("full" HIFU) or just certain portions ("focused" HIFU) and the procedure takes from 1-4 hours.</p>
              <p>
              HIFU has been used in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, to treat prostate cancer for about 10 years. However, it is not currently approved by the Food & Drug Administration for use in the United States.

            <h5>DASAM™</h5>
            <p>
              InnovaHealth’s DASAM™ is an Integrated Treatment Planning & Robotic Navigation system for CT guided tumor Ablation. It was introduced in India in late 2013. DASAM is USFDA, Japanese PMDA, European CE and China CFDA approve among many other regulatory clearances. It is installed in top medical facilities in India, Australia, China, Germany, USA, Vietnam etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              DASAM™ is an image-guided, physician controlled stereotactic accessory to a Computed Tomography (CT) system. It is intended for the stereotactic spatial positioning & orientation of an end effector and instrument guide. DASAM™ assists in manual advancement of one or more instruments such as rigid straight needles and probes during CT guided percutaneous procedures on organs and anatomical structures in the thorax, abdomen and pelvis.
            </p>
            <p>
              DASAM can perform a Biopsy in 20-30 minutes and ablation in approximately 2 hours. DASAM can perform 4-6 procedures per day in normal use.
            </p>
            <p>DASAM’s treatment planning and robotic navigation helps physicians to:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-size">
              <li>“Plan and Treat” inoperable, difficult to access tumors in liver, lung, pancreas, kidney, bone etc. </li>
              <li>Achieve “Complete tumor coverage”: Potentially minimizes residual tumor & recurrence. </li>
              <li>Use up to 6 electrodes on up to 4 tumors simultaneously</li>
            </ul><br><br>
          </div>
          <div class="content-left">
            <h5>&nbsp; </h5>
            <p>DASAM consists of a stereotactic device and its accessories, software loaded on a computer, and a respiratory gating system. The accessories include a patient immobilizer and skin-markers. </p>

            <%= image_tag("cim/DASAM.png", class:'img-dasam') %>
            <p>The technology used in DASAM to drive the robotic movement is Electro-Mechanical System. This is a Robotic system that uses motion control components to position a needle holding device at the planned point on the planned trajectory. This is done in such a manner that when the user advances a tool (electrode) of pre-specified length, the distal end of the tool will reach the tumor without the need for monitoring or any other feedback. The assumption is that the patient is immobilized and the tumor (target) is non-moving. These assumptions to a large extent are made good using accessories like the patient immobilizer and breath-hold monitoring device. </p>
            <p>Motion control is created by using the Electro-Mechanical System, Motion Control Software and Application Software. The combination of the three provides InnovaHealth with Robotic capabilities.</p>

            <p class="text-intro">DASAM™ is used in different stages of the treatment</p>
              <strong>Pre-operative</strong><br>
              <p>The DASAM system provides pre-operative planning assistance to the physician by creating a  reconstructed 3D image model of received CT  data and by visually representing the planned  instrument path and position(s) of one or more  instruments on the model, along with performance data provided by the instrument manufacturer or as specified by the user. DASAM’s powerful planning software provides 2D and volumetric visualization of anatomical region(s), encompassing the tumour to be treated, to aid in the development of the plan. InnovaHealth’s Robotics systems are mobile and provide six degrees of freedom (DOF) with 3 linear and 2 rotary axis.</p>
              <br>
              <strong>Intra-operative</strong><br>
              <p>DASAM™ permits physician verification of patient position prior to needle advancement and monitoring of respiratory levels during the procedure. Image registration and overlay tools available in DASAM™ are intended to provide guidance to the user during planning and instrument placement. With the click of a button, the arm moves into position for the physician to advance the instruments. Intra-operative registration allows verification of instrument(s) placement prior to procedure.</p>
              <br>
              <strong>Post-operative</strong><br>
              <p>Post-procedure images can be viewed and compared to the plan or pre-operative images.</p>

              InnovaHealth is also starting a “pay-per-use model”. This model is currently deployed in three locations in the USA and Canada on a trial basis. Under this model, InnovaHealth charges approximately $1,500 per procedure and expects earnings of $21,000 - $24,000 per month from each of the machines deployed. This is based on the expectation that each machine will be used 15 times (10 Biopsies and 3-4 Ablations) in a month.
